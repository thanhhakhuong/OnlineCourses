        <p>
          Retro interior design is an eclectic mix of old styles and new forms,
          or new forms with old materials and finishes. Any era can be tapped
          into here, with the 50s, 60s and 70s the most common. It embraces a
          kaleidoscope of contrasting design features, colours, shapes and form.
          The ratio of old to new will bring a more intense and defined
          understanding of this look. Your colour palette could be a diverse mix
          of brights or muddy muted neutrals or a 60s vogue monotone scheme.
          Motifs pull from the art deco, nouveau, oversized and psychedelic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Retro style furniture has an abstract feel to it, with each piece
          almost fighting for the limelight as the focal point of the room.
          Sofas are broad and elongated with multi-colored throw pillows for an
          added dash of color. Shiny chrome barstools with bright red seats draw
          your attention to a wet bar or diner-style kitchen while Mitt chairs
          and puzzle-piece ottomans provide unique seating for guests.

        <p>
          Taking inspiration from the outdoors and a combination of farmhouse
          and industrial interior design styles, rustic décor places an emphasis
          on natural and weathered finishes, raw wood, stone, and leather, with
          unexpected touches and an overall sophisticated bent.

        <p>
          We love how the room featured above fuses a varied mix of
          statement-making furnishings like the custom plush sherpa sofas, the
          industrial inspired wire pendants, and unique leather chairs. That
          said, we’re all for modern interior design styles that combine various
          elements to create a beautifully realized, one-of-a-kind room.

          One of the most timeless and endlessly popular interior design styles
          out there, bohemian décor represents a care and fuss-free freedom
          that’s unquestionably heady and intoxicating. Boasting a globally
          inspired comfortable mix of exotic finds and vintage and antique
          furnishings sourced from passionate flea-market treks and travels, the
          eclectic style also touches on hints of everyday glamor via crystal
          extras, beaded fabrications, jewel tones, and overall relaxed mood.

        <p>
          The minimalist decorating style is an exercise in restraint, where
          space, lighting, and objects play equally important roles. This style
          demands you to pare down your furnishings to the bare essentials so
          that you're left with a set of curated objects that deliver maximum
          impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          Minimalist interior design is very similar to modern interior design
          and involves using the bare essentials to create a simple and
          uncluttered space. It’s characterised by simplicity, clean lines, and
          a monochromatic palette with colour used as an accent. It usually
          combines an open floor plan, lots of light, and functional furniture,
          and it focuses on the shape, colour and texture of just a handful of
          essential elements.

        <p>
          Increasingly popular, Scandinavian interior design styles emphasize a
          clean and serene simplicity that’s universal in appeal. Fully
          functional and minimal to a degree, Scandinavian décor highlights
          organic shapes with subtle interest, tonal textural plays, and a
          relaxed appeal in all-white spaces with gray undertones. Hints of
          color are brought in via art and a single textile such as a small
          throw or rug.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the easiest to master of contemporary interior design styles,
          Scandinavian interior design is all about a balanced and carefully
          edited mix of elements. Though there are plenty of interior design
          styles trends that take cues from Scandinavian interior design styles,
          we’re all about going full throttle as this is one design movement
          that’s worth taking note of.

        <p>
          High Tech Interior Design is a modern design trend with focus on
          cutting-edge technology, straight lines, clear geometric shapes and
          futuristic furniture.
        </p>

        <p>
          High-tech is an architectural design style that emerged in the Late
          Modernism period in the 1970s and has been widely used in the 1980s.
          Mostly Englishmen are major theorists and practitioners of high-tech.
          They are Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Nicholas Grimshaw, James
          Stirling at some phase of his oeuvre, and the Italian, Renzo Piano.
          This style originated in the industrial premises design, where all the
          elements are functional. Different elements of industrial aesthetics
          were used in the living accommodations, where they have been developed
          into a mixture of high technology and constructivism.

        <p>
          As the name evokes an urban vibe with warehouse and factory elements
          thrown in the mix, it should come as no surprise that industrial
          interior design practices lend a clean, somewhat masculine and minimal
          spirit to any room. Think a neutral color scheme, reclaimed machinery,
          moody hues, raw woods and unfinished metals, and ultimately,
          statement-making throwbacks with a slightly steampunk feel.
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, we wouldn’t recommend going industrial when considering the
          best interior design styles for small house as this is one aesthetic
          that calls for plenty of breathing room to take in the often oversized
          machinery inspired elements. However, you can inject small doses of
          the design movement when looking at industrial interior design styles
          living room by incorporating raw metal decorative extras say on a
          bookshelf here, or a in small nook there.
