              <strong> Dresden </strong> is the capital city of the German state of
              Saxony and its second most populous city, after Leipzig. It is the
              12th most populous city of Germany, the fourth largest by area
              (following Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne), and the third most populous
              city in the area of former East Germany, following Berlin and Leipzig.
              Dresden's urban area comprises the towns of Freital, Pirna, Radebeul,
              Coswig and Heidenau and has around 790,000 inhabitants.The Dresden
              metropolitan area has approximately 1.34 million inhabitants.

              <strong> Dresden </strong> is the second largest city on the River
              Elbe after Hamburg. Most of the city's population lives in the Elbe
              Valley, but a large, albeit very sparsely populated area of the city
              east of the Elbe lies in the West Lusatian Hill Country and Uplands
              (the westernmost part of the Sudetes) and thus in Lusatia, while many
              boroughs west of the Elbe lie in the foreland of the Ore Mountains as
              well as in the valleys of the rivers rising there and flowing through
              Dresden, the longest of which are the Wei√üeritz and the Lockwitzbach.
              The name of the city as well as the names of most of its boroughs and
              rivers are of Slavic origin.

              <strong> Dresden </strong> has a long history as the capital and royal
              residence for the Electors and Kings of Saxony, who for centuries
              furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendor, and was once
              by personal union the family seat of Polish monarchs. The city was
              known as the Jewel Box, because of its baroque and rococo city centre.
              The controversial American and British bombing of Dresden in World War
              II towards the end of the war killed approximately 25,000 people, many
              of whom were civilians, and destroyed the entire city centre. After
              the war, restoration work has helped to reconstruct parts of the
              historic inner city.

              Since German reunification in 1990, <strong> Dresden </strong> has
              again become a cultural, educational and political centre of Germany.
              The Dresden University of Technology is one of the 10 largest
              universities in Germany and part of the German Universities Excellence
              Initiative. The economy of Dresden and its agglomeration is one of the
              most dynamic in Germany and ranks first in Saxony. It is dominated by
              high-tech branches, often called "Silicon Saxony". According to the
              Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWI) and Berenberg
              Bank, in 2019, Dresden had the seventh best prospects for the future
              of all cities in Germany.
